Wed Jun 14 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Jun 14 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Improved (synth) identification for (0,6),(5,5),10 Intel
	  Xeon Scalable (3rd Gen) (Cooper Lake A0), based on 634897 doc.
	* cpuid.c: Changed (synth) identification for (0,6),(6,12) Intel Xeon
	  D-1700/2700 (Ice Lake-D).  Intel docs 714071 claim the stepping is
	  U1/U2, which contradicts ILPMDF*.  I'm using the actual docs.
	* cpuid.c: Updated comments with new Intel docs.
	* cpuid.c: Changed "Intel Scalable" to "Intel Xeon Scalable".
	* cpuid.man: Added new Intel docs.
	* cpuid.man: Added 613537, the new pub number for 336065, Intel Xeon
	  Processor Scalable Family Specification Update.

Mon Jun  5 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) differentiation for (0,6),(9,10),4 Intel
	  Pentium Gold 8500 series.

Sat May 13 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Made the (simple synth) fields non-default.  Too many people
	  were interpreting them as definitive and ignoring the much better
	  (synth) leaf, which uses the entirety of cpuid information.  This
	  impacts leaves 1, 0x80000001, and 0x80860001.  The (simple synth)
	  fields still are available, but only with the -S/--simple option.
	* cpuid.c: Organized option flags that need to be passed deeply down in
	  the print_reg* functions into a new print_opts_t, which will make
	  future options easier to add.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed the old "try" variables to "sub".  The word "try" was
	  a remnant of the original leaf 4 subleaf implemntation, before
	  subleaves were commonplace.  For leaf 4, one just kept "trying" to
	  read more cache data until it failed.  But most subleaves don't work
	  that way.

Sat May 13 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated (synth) decoding for (0,6),(8,15),{7,8} to mention
	  steppings {S2,S3} from ILPMDF* 20230512.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for (0,6),(11,14) pure Atom x7000E,
	  as a variation on other Alder Lake-N CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for (0,6),(9,10),4 Atom C1100 Arizona
	  Beach.

Thu May  5 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Fri May  5 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bug in (multi-processing synth) in the recently
	  rewritten decode_mp_synth().  The CPU counts for higher levels were
	  not dividing out counts from lower levels.  This is analogous to the
	  way print_apic_synth() subtracts out bit widths from lower levels.

Fri May  5 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate Core i3-N300 N-Series from ordinary N-Series.
	  (They appear to differ only in branding.)

Fri Apr 28 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added hypervisor+4/eax bit 21: use hypercalls for MMIO config
	  space I/O, based on LX* (Michael Kelley PCI pass-thru patches).  Not
	  documented by Microsoft yet.

Tue Apr 25 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: In real_setup(), make inability to switch to CPU 0 no longer
	  a fatal error.  It is allowable for CPU 0 to be offlined, just like any
	  other.

Tue Apr 18 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for (0,6),(8,15) Xeon W version of
	  Sapphire Rapids, from instlatx64 sample.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (synth) & (uarch synth) for Sapphire Rapids:
	  family is Golden Cove, not Sunny Cove.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) & (uarch synth) Emerald Rapids family:
	  Raptor Cove.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) & (uarch synth) Granite Rapids family:
	  Redwood Cove.
	* cpuid.c: In decode_uarch_intel, mark Sapphire Rapids, Emerald Rapids
	  & Granite Rapids with core_is_uarch to avoid replicating the name in
	  (synth).

Sun Apr 16 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for (0,6),(10,10),2 Meteor Lake-M B0
	  from Coreboot*.

Thu Apr  6 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Thu Apr  6 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bug in print_apic_synth() when interpreting leaf 0xb
	  and 0x1f bit widths: In fact, they are bit *offsets*, different from
	  the *widths* of leaf 4!  So the (APIC width synth) often has been off
	  by 1, and the (APIC synth) PKG_ID & CORE_ID values often have been
	  shifted incorrectly.
	* cpuid.c: For 0xb/*/eax & 0x1f/*/eax, rename field to "bit width of
	  level & previous levels" to reflect this definition.
	* cpuid.c: In print_apic_synth(), decode_mp_synth(), and
	  print_mp_synth(), support APIC bit fields for the newest 4 topology
	  layers: module, tile, die, die group.  And for the mp version, also
	  the older cu & pkg levels.
	* cpuid.c: In print_apic_synth(), use the extended APIC ID's when
	  available in a variety of leaves.
	* cpuid.c: In print_apic_synth() & decode_mp_synth(), support leaf 0xb
	  method for AMD/Hygon.
	* cpuid.c: In decode_mp_synth(), for the 1/0x80000008 method, use the
	  same family-specific technique to differentiate CU's from cores, or
	  cores from threads as in print_apic_synth().

Tue Apr  4 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added prelim Bergamo A1 stepping from sample from @YuuKi_AnS.

Fri Mar 31 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/1/edx AMX-COMPLEX instructions.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/2/edx UC-lock disable.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x10/n/ecx non-contiguous 1s value supported.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x1c/ecx event logging supported bitmap.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x23/0/ebx decoding.

Tue Mar 28 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Decode 0x80000026/1/ebx core type & native model.

Tue Mar 28 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: For 0x80000021/eax, capitalize REP STOSB & REP CMPSB to match
	  Intel versions in 7/1/eax.
	* cpuid.c: For 0x80000022/ecx, shorten description, show bitmask only in
	  hex.

Tue Mar 28 2023 Smita Koralahalli Channabasappa <Smita.KoralahalliChannabasappa@amd.com>
	* cpuid.c: Update CPUID utility with new feature bits as documented in
	  the AMD Processor Programming Reference for Family 19h and Model 11h:
	  0x8000000a/edx extended LVT offset fault change
	  0x80000021/eax enhanced predictive store forwarding, FSRS, FSRC,
	  FsGsKernelGsBaseNonSerializing
	  0x80000022/ebx number of available UMC PMCs
	  0x80000022/ecx bitmask representing active UMCs

Tue Mar 28 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate preliminary (uarch synth) for (0,6),(10,10);
	  (0,6),(10,11); (0,6),(10,12); and (0,6),(11,5) Crestmont Atom cores
	  from their Redwood Cove counterparts.
	* cpuid.c: Add preliminary (synth) & (uarch synth) for (0,6),(12,6)
	  Lion Cove & Skymont, from LX*.

Sat Mar 25 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 12/0/eax SGX ENCLS EUPDATESVN bit.

	  Xeons to Ice Lake-SP.  Also, improved decoding for engr samples where
	  the brand string omits Xeon & Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum.

Fri Mar 17 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Improved (synth) decoding for (0,6),(11,14) Intel N-Series.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (synth) & (uarch synth) for (0,6),(11,14)
	  Alder Lake-N based on core type, much like for other Alder Lake models.
	  This corrects the cores to Gracemont.  As for Golden Cove, perhaps
	  P-cores never will exist for this model but, if they do, they should
	  now be decoded correctly.
	* cpuid.man: Added 759603: Intel Processor and Intel Core i3 N-Series
	  Datasheet, Volume 1 of 2.
	* cpuid.c: Updated (synth) decoding for (0,6),(11,15),5 with
	  Raptor Lake-S/HX/P.
	* cpuid.c: Updated (synth) decoding for (0,6),(11,10) with
	  Raptor Lake-H/U/P.

Mon Mar  6 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Mar  5 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Based on Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files (ILPMDF*), made
	  the following (synth) changes:
	* cpuid.c: Updated (0,6),(3,7),8 Bay Trail with stepping name C0.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(4,5),1 Haswell-ULT C0/D0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (0,6),(4,6),1 Crystal Well to C0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Updated (0,6),(4,7),1 Broadwell to include E0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(5,5),3 Skylake B1 (Xeon Scalable).
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(5,5),5 Skylake A0 (Xeon Scalable).
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(5,5),11 Cooper Lake A1 (Xeon Scalable).
	* cpuid.c: Updated (0,6),(5,14),3 Skylake-H/S/E3, adding N0 & S0
	  steppings.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(6,10),5 Ice Lake C0 (Xeon Scalable).
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(6,12),1 Ice Lake B0.
	* cpuid.c: Updated (0,6),(8,6),4 Snow Ridge with stepping B0.
	* cpuid.c: Updated (0,6),(8,6),5 Snow Ridge with stepping B1.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(8,6),1 Lakefield B2/B3 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (0,6),(8,12),1 Tiger Lake stepping to B1.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(8,12),2 Tiger Lake C0.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(8,14),10 Coffee Lake D0.

	* cpuid.c: Updated (0,6),(9,12) Jasper Lake with stepping A1.

Thu Mar  2 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (0,6),(8,10) Lakefield P-cores from Tremont
	  E-cores, much as I previously did for Alder Lake & Raptor Lake.
	* cpuid.c: In decode_uarch_intel, for known Hybrid chips (Alder Lake,
	  Raptor Lake & Lakefield), only decode the uarch if it's one of the two
	  known hybrid types.  However, some (0,6),(9,7) Alder Lake's are
	  non-hybrid (Golden Cove only), so also decode core type == 0x00 there.
	* cpuid.c: In the Intel Core era, uarch families are identified only by
	  the initial uarch in the family.  So the family names in {braces},
	  which also are uarch names, can be confusing.  So, change (synth) and
	  (uarch synth) for those families to explain the relationships between
	  the subsequent uarch and the initial uarch, in the form of
	  "shrink of", "optim of", and the unusual "backport of".
	* cpuid.c: Added (4th Gen) to the (synth) description of (10,15),(1,*)
	  AMD EPYC Genoa.
	* cpuid.c: Updated (synth) for (10,15),(7,*) AMD Phoenix & Phoenix 2
	  CPUs to claim 4nm process.

Tue Feb 28 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Feb 26 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected 7/1/eax fast REP instructions, where I'd left the
	  REP prefix out of the description.

Wed Feb 22 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/1/eax FRED & LKGS bits, from Intel Flexible Return and
	  Event Deliver (FRED).
	* cpuid.man: Added Intel Flexible Return and Event Deliver (FRED).
	* cpuid.c: Clarified 7/1/eax ArchPerfmonExt, which indicates that leaf
	  0x23 is valid.

Fri Feb 17 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (uarch synth) decoding for AMD Ryzen (Phoenix E0), based
	  on sample from bakerlab.org, which I missed on Oct 3 2022, when I
	  added the (synth) decoding.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000001/ebx PkgType decoding for AMD (10,15) Family
	  19h CPUs: (2,1) Vermeer, (5,1) Cezanne/Barcelo, (6,1) Raphael, and
	  (7,0) Phoenix, based on their respective PPPR's.

Sun Feb 12 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added very early (synth) decoding for Lunar Lake.  There is
	  no corresponding (uarch synth) decoding, because no name is yet known
	  for the uarch.

Sat Feb 11 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(9,10) Alder Lake Core names: i*-12000.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (0,6),(9,7) & (0,6),(9,10) Alder Lake Gracemont
	  E-cores from Golden Cove P-cores.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (0,6),(11,7); (0,6),(11,10) & (0,6),(11,15)
	  Raptor Lake Gracemont E-cores from Raptor Cove P-cores.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) & (uarch synth) decoding for (10,15),(7,8)
	  Phoenix 2, from Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed print_hypervisor_3_eax_xen to
	  print_hypervisor_3_0_eax_xen.
	* cpuid.c: Added print_hypervisor_3_0_ebx_xen and decode Xen tsc mode.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for (10,15),(6,1,1) Raphael B1.

Fri Jan 20 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Fri Jan 20 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Eliminate reliance on "old" build system.  Instead, for the cpuid.i386
	  and cpuid.x86_64, meant to be executable anywhere, including on old
	  hardware & distros, use static builds.  They're much bigger, but
	  utterly immune to library changes.

Wed Jan 18 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Intel's 13th Generation Core datasheet provides stepping names as
	  well as numbers!  So:
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for (0,6),(11,7) Raptor Lake B0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for (0,6),(11,15) Raptor Lake C0
	  steppings, and clarified case for unknown stepping.
	* cpuid.man: Added 743844: 13th Generation Core datasheet.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed (0,6)(12,15) synth typo: Emearld Rapids.

	* cpuid.c: Clarified 7/0/edx IA32_TSX_FORCE_ABORT MSR.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/1/edx CET_SSS: shadow stacks w/o page faults.
	* cpuid.c: Added several 7/2/edx bits.
	* cpuid.c: In 0xd/0/eax, corrected CET_U & CET_S, which were IA32_XSS.
	* cpuid.c: In 0xd/0/eax, removed the IA32_XSS bits, which aren't
	  relevant for XCR0.
	* cpuid.c: For 0xd/1/ecx, enumerate the IA32_XSS bits instead of a
	  hex bitmask.
	* cpuid.c: For 0xd, added IA32_XSS PASID state (couple places).
	* cpuid.c: Renamed 0x1a: Native Model ID.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth & uarch decoding for (0,6),(11,15) Raptor Lake
	  from MSR_CPUID_table*.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for (0,6),(9,7),5 Pentium Gold G7400,
	  based on instlatx64 sample.
	* cpuid.c: Added rudimentary synth decoding for future (0,6),(12,15)
	  Emerald Rapids CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/1/eax LASS: linear address space separation.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected 0x18/n/edx maximum number of addressible IDs, which
	  should use minus-one notation.

Tue Jan 17 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Certain leaves cannot be displayed correctly in isolation,
	  i.e. without information about other leaves saved in the stash.  For
	  example, the display for leaf 3 uses bits saved from leaf 1.  If the
	  -l/--leaf option is used to restrict cpuid to reading only a single
	  leaf, such leaves now are displayed as raw hex, rather than with
	  incorrect information.  This is handled by passing a NULL stash to
	  print_reg() and below, and by many new checks for a NULL stash.
	  Thanks to Bill Zissimopoulos for the bug report.

Mon Jan  9 2023 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated cache associativity strings used in 0x80000006 and
	  0x80000019 leaves to use value ranges, as in AMD docs.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed mistake in AMD L3 range reservation support: it's in
	  0x80000020/0 register EBX, not ECX.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000026/0/edx extended APIC ID.

Tue Dec 13 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added synth & uarch decoding for (10,15),(1,1) Genoa, from
	  AMD 57095 revision guide.

	* Added uarch & synth decoding for AMD 4800S Desktop Kit, based on
	  instlatx64 sample.  The generation is known to be Zen 2 (7nm), but
	  the core is unknown.  I heard speculation for each of Ariel (rejected
	  PlayStation 5 CPU), or Lockhart/Scarlett (rejected Xbox CPU).
	* Added uarch decoding for AMD Genoa A1, based on instlatx64 sample
	  from @IanCutress.

Mon Nov 28 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>

	  VIRT_RMPUPDATE & VIRT_PSMASH MSR support.
	* Added 0x80000020/0/ecx bit: L3 range reservation support.
	* Added 0x80000021/eax bits: automatic IBRS,
	  CPUID disable for non-privileged.
	* Added 0x80000022/eax bit: AMD LBR & PMC freezing.

	  on MSR_CPUID_table*, and updated comments (no functional changes).
	* cpuid.c: Renamed 7/0/eax enh hardware feedback to simply Thread
	  Director.  Evidently, Intel just calls it that now too.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/1/eax RAO-INT instructions, CMPccXADD instructions,
	  ArchPerfmonExt is valid, WRMSRNS instructions, AMX-FP16, AVX-IFMA,
	  RDMSRLIST & WRMSRLIST.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/1/edx AVX-VNNI-INT8, AVX-NE-CONVERT, PREFETCHIT*
	  instructions.

Wed Aug 17 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed missing return statement in get_nr_cpu_ids()'s default
	  case, used by Cygwin.  Thanks to Brian Inglis for reporting this.

Tue Aug 16 2022 Umio-Yasuno <coelacanth_dream@proton.me>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed title for AMD 0x8000001a leaf: Performance Optimization
	  Identifiers.

Fri Aug 12 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Fri Aug 12 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (synth) decoding for (0,6),(8,6) Intel Snow
	  Ridge/Parker Ridge.  It had been lumped in with Elkhart Lake, but only
	  because that had been the only known core name for the Tremont uarch.
	  These appear to be different cores.  Also added steppings from SSG*.

Fri Aug  5 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 8000000a/edx X2AVIC flag, from Linux kernel patches
	  It appears to be undocumented, so far.

Thu Aug  4 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Improved (synth) decoding for (0,6),(9,7),2, adding
	  Added Alder Lake-HX.

Wed Jul 27 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Reverted May 27 2022 split of 7/0/ebx hack to report bit 22
	  as RDPID on AMD architectures.  The AMD documentation is inconsistent
	  on the location of this flag.  In E.3.6, it claims 7/0/ebx.  But in
	  section 3, the RDPID instruction itself claims 7/0/ecx, as does the
	  mention in Table 3-1.  This also is consistent with Intel
	  architectures.  Thanks to Stefan Kanthak for pointing this out.

Mon Jul 25 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Generalized (0,6),(8,14),9,YP stepping case to include
	  Pentium 4425Y, from instlatx64 sample.

Thu Jul 14 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated 7/0/edx comments to reflect original info source
	  for SRBDS mitigation MSR available, previously just marked LX*.
	* cpuid.c: Updated 7/0/edx comments to reflect original info source
	  for RTM transaction always aborts, previously just marked LX*.
	* cpuid.c: Added (vuln to branch type confusion synth) synthetic leaf
	  to correct for the one known inaccuracy.
	* cpuid.man: Added those two original source web pages from Intel:
	  Intel Transactional Synchronization Extensions (Intel TSX) Memory and
	  Performance Monitoring Update for Intel Processors (Article ID
	  000059422), Special Register Buffer Data Sampling.

Wed Jul 13 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000008/ebx not vulnerable to branch type confusion
	  flag from "Technical Guidance For Mitigating Branch Type Confusion
	  (White Paper)".  Also added a synthetic flag to correct the special
	  case for Family 0x19, where the raw flag is documented to be wrong.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/2/edx indirect branch prediction related flags from
	  Intel's "Branch History Injection and Intra-mode Branch Target
	  Injection / CVE-2022-0001, CVE-2022-0002 / INTEL-SA-00598".
	* cpuid.c: Added (uarch synth) decoding for (0,6),(6,14) Cougar
	  Mountain, mentioned as Airmont by Intel's "Retpoline: A Branch Target
	  Injection Mitigation".
	* cpuid.man: Added "Branch History Injection and Intra-mode Branch Target
	  Injection / CVE-2022-0001, CVE-2022-0002 / INTEL-SA-00598" and
	  "Retpoline: A Branch Target Injection Mitigation".

Tue Jul 12 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified (synth) for (0,6),(8,13) Tiger Lake-H from SSG*.

Tue Jul 12 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added support for hypervisor+3/ecx (Microsoft) flags.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for hypervisor+0xa/eax (Microsoft) VMCS
	  GuestIa32DebugCtl support flag.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for hypervisor+0xa/ebx (Microsoft) VMCS
	  HvFlushGuestPhysicalAddress* flag.

Wed Jun 29 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) for (0,6),(11,10),3 Raptor Lake-P Q0, from
	  Coreboot*.

Sat Jun 25 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Lionel Debroux's patch used MAX_CPUS all the time.  But it
	  really was meaningful only for the USE_KERNEL_SCHED_SETAFFINITY case
	  (although, by happenstance, it may have been correct for all three
	  cases).  Replace this with an nr_cpu_ids global, determined by
	  get_nr_cpu_ids().  The simplest version just returns
	  sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF), although that could be problematic on
	  systems with non-contiguous CPU numbers.
	* cpuid.c: For USE_KERNEL_SCHED_SETAFFINITY, improve this, and also
	  support systems with > 1024 CPUs, by estimating nr_cpu_ids using a
	  power-of-2 walk through successively larger cpu_set_t sizes until
	  sched_getaffinity succeeds.
	* cpuid.c: For systems using cpu_set_t (only Cygwin?), cap the
	  nr_cpu_ids to CPU_SETSIZE.
	* cpuid.c: The _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF check in real_setup() is removed
	  because it's redundant now.

Wed Jun 22 2022 Lionel Debroux <lionel_debroux@yahoo.fr>
	* cpuid.c: In do_real() and do_real_one(), avoid breaking out of loop
	  because of downed CPUs.

Mon Jun 20 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sat Jun 18 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) for (0,6),(9,7),1 Alder Lake-S B0 from
	  Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) stepping name for (0,6),(9,7),4 Alder Lake-U G0
	  from Coreboot* (although this dubiously mixes partly contradictory
	  info from two sources).
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) stepping name for (0,6),(9,7),5 Alder Lake-S H0
	  from Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added hypervisor+4/eax (Xen) upcalls with physical IRQ
	  vectors from Xen*.
	* cpuid.c: Added hypervisor+{0x80,0x81,0x82} (Microsoft) synthetic
	  debugging leaves.
	* cpuid.c: Eliminated print_header(), and distributed those headers
	  throughout print_reg(), frequently using the try (subleaf) number to
	  ensure they are printed only once.  Many headers already were like
	  this, and it makes them more consistent.

Sun Jun 12 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed (synth) for Alder Lake-S to remove K/KF suffixes,
	  because other suffixes (or no suffix) are available too.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) for (0,6),(9,7),5 Alder Lake-S.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) for (0,6),(9,7),3 Alder Lake-P/H.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) for (0,6),(9,7),4 Alder Lake-U.

Sat Jun 11 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 0xf/1/eax QoS monitoring counter size, both in raw
	  form (-24 notation) and as a synthetic leaf the determines the
	  value from the raw form and family/model information.
	* cpuid.c: Added stash information to print_header() to avoid printing
	  Xen-only headers for hypervisor+3 leaves of other hypervisors.
	* cpuid.c: Rewrote the handling of subleaves (tries) for legacy raw
	  input files.  Originally, I thought I only needed this support for
	  those leaves which existed during that legacy period.  But the
	  testbeds lean on that support for samples from instlatx64.  So now
	  it's more general.
	* cpuid.c: For leaf 0x80000020, rewrote the rules for subleaf processing
	  based on the description in AMD64 Technology Platform Quality of
	  Service Extensions (pub 56375 1.03): walk the bits in the mask.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000020/0/ebx bits 2 & 3, and renamed bit 1.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000020/1 subleaf header.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000020/2 subleaf.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000020/3 subleaf.
	* cpuid.man: Added 56375: AMD64 Technology Platform Quality of Service
	  Extensions

Fri May 27 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x8000001f/eax virtual TSC_AUX supported, from Linux
	  kernel.
	* cpuid.c: Split 7/0/ebx decoding into Intel-specific & AMD-specific
	  versions (using ugly macro to avoid code duplication), differing by
	  bit 22: PCOMMIT (intel) vs. RDPID/TSC_AUX (amd).

Wed May 25 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000022/eax AMD perfmon V2, from Linux kernel.

Tue May 24 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x21 TDX guest leaf, as ASCII text
	  (e.g. "IntelTDX    ").

Sat May 21 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed (synth) for AMD (10,15),(5,*) Cezanne to also mention
	  Barcelo, because instlatx64 samples show that they seem to be
	  indistinguishable from cpuid information.

Tue May 17 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for stepping (0,6),(11,10),2
	  Raptor Lake-P J0 from Coreboot*.

Tue May  3 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added 344425, "Architecture Specification: Intel Trust
	  Domain Extensions (Intel TDX) Module".
	* cpuid.c: Removed 7/0/ecx bus lock detection LX*, Qemu* comment,
	  because it now is documented in the above.
	* cpuid.man: Added 343754, "Intel Trust Domain CPU Architectural
	  Extensions".
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x12/0/eax bit 7: EVERIFYREPORT2 support, from the
	  above.

Tue May  3 2022 Stefan Kanthak <stefan.kanthak@nexgo.de>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected spelling of 7/0/ecx "RDPID: read processor ID
	  supported".

Mon May  2 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified (synth) decoding for (10,15),(11,14) Alder Lake-N,
	  based on LX*. Also added A0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added defined() checks around uses of __GNUC__,
	  __GNUC_MINOR__, and __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__, as suggested by Stefan
	  Kanthak.
	* Makefile: Added -Wundef to compilation options to check the above,
	  although they always are defined with gcc.
	* cpuid.c: To simplify the new #if's for __builtin_clzl, added new
	  USE_BUILTIN_CLZL macro.

Sat Apr 30 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for (10,15),(0,1),2 Milan B2 stepping.

Tue Apr  5 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed (0,6),(9,10) Alder Lake synth decoding stepping names,
	  based on Coreboot*, evidently from Intel doc 626774.  I cannot find
	  that document.  Perhaps it is under NDA.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(1,9) ZhangJiang synth & uarch decoding from
	  Google_cpu_features*.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,7),(1,11) WuDaoKou synth & uarch decoding from
	  Google_cpu_features*.  Also corrected (0,7),(0,11) uarch decoding.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,7),(3,11) LuJiaZui uarch decoding from
	  Google_cpu_features*.  Also simplified its synth decoding.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,7),(5,11) YongFeng synth & uarch decoding from
	  Google_cpu_features*.  Still somewhat speculative.

Fri Mar 25 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added hypervisor+4/eax (Microsoft) bits 15, 17, 18.
	* cpuid.c: Added hypervisor+4/ecx (Microsoft) leaf.
	* cpuid.c: Added many hypervisor+6/eax (Microsoft) fields.
	* cpuid.c: Added hypervisor+0xa/eax (Microsoft) bit 22.
	* cpuid.c: Added hypervisor+3/ebx (Microsoft) Isolation flag, from Linux
	  kernel (arch/x86/include/asm/hyperv-tlfs.h).
	* cpuid.c: Added hypervisor+0xc/{eax,ebx} (Microsoft) leaves, from Linux
	  kernel (arch/x86/include/asm/hyperv-tlfs.h).

Fri Mar 18 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (synth) for (0,6),(9,10) Alder Lake to report Core
	  where appropriate, instead of Atom always.  In fact, I've seen zero
	  instances of Atoms with this core, so perhaps this was an early
	  misunderstanding.  The (0,6),(9,7) Alder Lake-S core was added at the
	  same time, also as an Atom, but was corrected much earlier.  So I've
	  made the same correction here.

Sat Mar 12 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for (8,15),(9,0),2 Van Gogh A2 from
	  instlatx64 sample.

Thu Mar 10 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for (0,6),(10,10),{0-1} A0 steppings,
	  based on info from Coreboot*.

Thu Feb 24 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Feb 23 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) and (uarch synth) decoding for AMD Rembrandt E1.

Sat Feb 19 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added hypervisor+4/eax (Xen) expanded destination id bit.

Mon Jan 17 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Removed bogus 7/1/eax bit 24 "AMX tile support".  The only
	  claim for that was an inaccurate comment in the linux kernel, added
	  2-Nov-2021, but the actual bit is in 7/0/edx, which already was
	  present in cpuid.

Sun Jan  9 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Renamed 6/eax bit to 23 to mention Thread Director.
	* cpuid.c: Widened 6/ecx number of enh hardware feedback classes from
	  bits 8-11 to bits 8-15.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed 7/1/eax bit to 10 to include "fast".
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/1/ebx decoding.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x14/0/ebx decoding for support for IA32_RTIT_CTL
	  EventEn & DisTNT bits.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for (0,6),(11,15) Alder Lake, based on
	  MSR_CPUID_table*.
	* cpuid.c: Confirmed synth decoding for (0,6),(10,8) Rocket Lake.

Tue Jan  4 2022 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) steppings based on instlatx64 samples:
	  1,(0,5),(0,3),2 P24T C0, (0,6),(0,2),2 K75/Pluto/Orion A2,
	  (0,6),(4,6),1 Crystal Well C1, (0,6),(7,14),5 Ice Lake-U/Y D1,
	  (0,6),(9,7),2 Alder Lake-S C0, (0,6),(10,7),1 Rocket Lake B0.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected missing Core name for (0,6),(9,7) Alder Lake-S A0
	  stepping.

Mon Dec 13 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: In 0x18 leaves, line up values better.

Fri Dec 10 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Fri Dec 10 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Reorganized loop over 0x12 subleaves in do_real().  The old
	  code assumed validity was at least partially determined by a bitmask
	  in subleaf 0 (like for leaf 0x10), but that was wrong.  Thanks to
	  Scott Raynor for pointing this out.
	* cpuid.c: Added code for 0x12/(n>=2) subleaves to show invalid cases as
	  such, instead of resorting to a raw dump.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed missing loop over 0x1b subleaves in do_real().  This
	  might become necessary if more target identifiers are added.
	* cpuid.c: Added print_1b_n_target() to decode the MKTME target
	  identifier.
	* cpuid.c: Modified leaf 4 subleaf loop to include the terminating
	  "no more caches" subleaf.  Modified print_reg() to abbreviate
	  "no more caches" subleaves.
	* cpuid.c: Cleaned up loops for leaves 7, 0x14, 0x17, 0x18, 0x1d, 0x20
	  subleaves: max_tries (from subleaf 0) is available before the loop
	  starts.
	* cpuid.c: Modified leaf 0xb subleaf loop to exit for the right reason,
	  level type == 0.  Also, it includes the terminating "invalid" subleaf.
	  The similiar 0x1f leaf already did this.

Mon Nov 29 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Fri Nov 26 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* From AMD Programmer's Manual, Vol 3, Rev 3.33, Appendix E:

	* Made new release.

Sun Nov 21 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Removed __LARGE64_FILES from __CYGWIN__, per Brian Inglis'
	  request.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed macros with names starting with underscores, which
	  are resered names in C: __THING -> MaskTHING, _THING -> ShftTHING.
	  Brian Inglis says this was an actual practical problem in Cygwin.
	  This change makes the code less dense, but a bit easier to understand.

Sat Nov 20 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish (synth) decoding: AMD (8,15),(2,0) Dali CPUs:
	  Ryzen vs. other.

	  series numbers.
	* cpuid.c: Added to (synth) decoding: AMD Epyc Gen numbers.
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish (synth) decodings for Threadripper CPUs.  For
	  Zen & Zen+, only the brand distinguishes; for Zen 2 (and rumored for
	  Zen 3), there are distinct models.
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish (synth) decoding between Great Horned Owl & Banded
	  Kestrel.
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish (synth) decoding for Grey Hawk from Renoir.

	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for Pentium Gold G5420 (0,6),(9,14),10,
	  based on a sample from Andrey Rahmatullin.  Previously, I knew only of
	  variants with stepping 11.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed Golden Cove & derivatives phys (physical properties)
	  to use new Intel 7 branding.  Likewise for the preliminary Redwood
	  Cove & Granite Rapids and Intel 4.

Sun Oct 31 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Oct 31 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Support hypervisors which can move their range of leaves
	  to other base addresses, to support hypervisors under other
	  hypervisors: IS_HYPERVISOR_LEAF(), print_hypervisor_*().
	* cpuid.c: Separated out get_hypervisor().  This ended up being
	  unnecessary, but I prefer it anyway.
	* cpuid.c: Added print_esc_substring() to print hypervisor_id values
	  that contain non-graphic characters.

Fri Oct 29 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>

Mon Oct 25 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Adapted patch from Brian Inglis for easier Cygwin cygport,
	  but made an effort to reduce duplicate header file references, and
	  use of <sys/cpuset.h> for the right reasons (i.e. a more general
	  change).
	* cpuid.c: For 12/n/ebx & 12/n/edx (n >= 2), mask the high 12 bits.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x40000001/eax(KVM) map gpa range hypercall &

	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for Vortex86EX2 & Vortex86DX2.  Info
	  on these is almost nonexistent, so it's possible that these rules are
	  too specific or too vague.

	* cpuid.c: restoring the deleted "AMD (unknown model)" entry.

Mon Jul 12 2021 Smita Koralahalli Channabasappa <Smita.KoralahalliChannabasappa@amd.com>
	* cpuid.c: updates the existing leaf and subleaf in the CPUID with
	  features related to INVLPGB, CPPC, PSFD, SEV [affects 0x80000008/edx,
	  0x80000008/edx, and 0x8000001f/eax].
	* cpuid.c: defines new leaf 80000021/eax.
	* cpuid.c: replaces the naming "Unknown Model" -> "AMD EPYC Milan" for
	  Family 19h and Model 01h [affects (synth) decoding].

Tue Feb  2 2021 Jonathan Teh <jonteh@ntlworld.com>
	* From http://datasheets.chipdb.org/Cyrix/112ap.pdf (page 7, table 1):
	* cpuid.c: Cyrix family 4 model 4 should be MediaGX or GXi
	* cpuid.c: GXm is family 5, model 4
	* cpuid.c: Cyrix MediaGX is derived from the 5x86 and unrelated to the
	  WinChip C6. Based on Wikipedia, the MediaGXm was renamed the Geode GXm
	  after it was sold to National Semi but the CPUs appear to have
	  continued to be sold under the Cyrix vendor up to and including the
	  Geode GX1. Hence, I've simply duplicated the names from NSC model 4
	  into Cyrix.
	* cpuid.c: Model 9 for the WinChip 3 is moved to the Centaur section
	  [decode_synth_via()], from the datasheet page 3-11:
	  http://datasheets.chipdb.org/IDT/x86/WinChip3/winchip_3_datasheet.pdf
	* cpuid.c: The Cyrix CPU detection guide [112ap] also offers some
	  possible codenames from page 20, table 17 Cx486SLC/DLC/SRx/DRx (M0.5)
	  up to table 26 for the GXm.

Mon Jan  4 2021 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected decode_amd_model()'s (0,15),(4,0) decodings for bti
	  values 0x29, 0x2a, and 0x2b.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected wrong register passed to print_40000001_edx_kvm().

Mon Nov  2 2020 Brian Inglis <Brian.Inglis@SystematicSw.ab.ca>
	* Makefile: Set BUILDROOT=$(DESTDIR) for easier Cygwin cygport support.

	* cpuid.c: Added (7,5),(2,6) AMD Cato (synth) decoding based on
	  instlatx64 example (possibly an engr sample).

Sun Oct  4 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected 6/edx size field to use minus-one notation.

Sun Oct  4 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) steppings for Comet Lake (0,6),(10,6) CPUs.
	  For the first time in a long time, Intel actually provided this in
	  the revision guide (615213)!
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (synth) decoding for AMD (8,15),(2,0) Dali CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for AMD Dali A1 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for AMD Picasso A1 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for AMD Renoir A1 stepping.

	* cpuid.c: Clarified synth decoding for (0,6),(8,10) Lakefield.
	* cpuid.c: Added KVM interrupt-based page-ready APF event flag.

Sat Aug  8 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected 0x20000001/edx header.
	* cpuid.c: Detect bogus 0x20000000 leaf values and cap the maximum
	  valid register for the 0x2xxxxxxx range to avoid absurdly long dumps
	  on old CPUs.

Mon Aug  3 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added bzero before cpuid instruction, in case the cpuid
	  instruction quietly fails.  This mostly is paranoia, but I don't see
	  how this ever could cause harm.

Mon Jun  8 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added Tiger Lake-U B0 stepping, from coreboot.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD (8,15),(2,0) Picasso model synth & uarch decoding.

Sun May 24 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added Zhaoxin KX-6000 decoding that still claims the vendor
	  CentaurHauls.  Later Zhaoxin CPUs were supposed to use their own
	  vendor, but instlat64x showed an example that still used the old one.

Sat May 16 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added better (synth) decoding for Intel Comet Lake-H/S
	  Core i*-10000 CPUs, based on instlatx64 example and listings in
	  ark.intel.com.

Tue Apr 28 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x8000000a/edx INVLPGB/TLBSYNC hypervisor intercept
	  enable flag.

Mon Apr 27 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Apr 22 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for AMD Steppe Eagle/Crowned Eagle
	  (Puma 2014 G-Series), based on instlatx64 sample.

Thu Apr 16 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/0/edx SERIALIZE & TSXLDTRK bit descriptions.

Tue Mar  3 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected field lengths in 14/0 and 14/1 subleafs so that
	  columns line up.

Thu Feb 27 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added CC150 (Coffee Lake R0) synth decoding, based on
	  instlatx64 example.

Wed Feb 26 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added Jasper Lake A0 stepping (from Coreboot*).
	* cpuid.c: Updated 1/ebx "cpu count" to modern terminology: "maximum
	  addressible IDs for CPUs in pkg" to avoid user confusion.  It was a
	  reliable count of the number of CPUs for only a split second some time
	  around 2002.  Maybe.
	* cpuid.c: Updated 4/eax CPU & core count terminology in the same way.

Tue Feb 11 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Mon Feb 10 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified Intel NNP-I (Spring Hill).
	* cpuid.c: In decode_vendor(), report "Zhaoxin" even with VENDOR_VIA,
	  if the brand string indicates so.
	* cpuid.c: In 0xc0000004/ebx, make current voltage use the shift-4 + 700
	  encoding used for other VIA voltages.

Fri Feb  7 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Use both Intel doc numbers for 329671/600827.
	* cpuid.man: Added missing 329901/600834 Intel doc.

Thu Feb  6 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added VIA 0xc0000004 leaf decoding.
	* cpuid.c: Added X2_IMAGES special flag to pretty-print values in the
	  2X encoding.
	* cpuid.c: Added MINUS1_IMAGES special flag to pretty-print values with
	  the "- 1" encoding.  (I finally got turned around about this being
	  better than the older "raw" values.)

Wed Feb  5 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Add VIA C7-D and Eden brands to (0,6),(0,10) (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate VIA (0,6),(0,13) (synth) based on brand strings.
	* cpuid.c: Overhaul of VIA 0xc0000002 leaf decoding.
	* cpuid.c: Updated VIA Nano steppings (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Removed extraneous WinChip & core words from C3 and later
	  VIA CPUs (synth).

Wed Feb  5 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed mp_synth fields to use '=' separator instead of ':',
	  like every other value.
	* cpuid.c: Changed processor serial number to use '=' separator instead
	  of ':', like every other value.

Tue Feb  4 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added 336907 doc with 7/0/ecx/TME bit description.
	* cpuid.c: Removed LX* comment from 7/0/ecx/TME bit description.  It's
	  documented after all.

Tue Feb  4 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified (0,6),(10,6) Comet Lake-U (synth).

Mon Feb  3 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Mon Feb  3 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Removed comments about (0,6),(8,14),10 contradiction.
	  Coreboot* removed the incorrect code claiming it was Coffee Lake D0.
	  The actual code already reflected this resolution.
	* cpuid.c: Removed now-redundant lines from decode_uarch_intel() for
	  the individual (0,6),(8,14) steppings.  They all say Kaby Lake now,
	  so they aren't necessary.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(4,14),8 Kaby Lake G0 and (0,6),(5,14),8
	  Kaby Lake-H A0 steppings to both (synth) and (uarch synth) that I found
	  in Coreboot*.  I realized I was worrying too much about them.  They are
	  at least wholly distinct steppings, so they don't constitute the
	  intra-stepping blurring that I saw with {Kaby,Amber,Whiskey,Comet}
	  Lake.  They are more akin to the already-existing Cascade Lake &
	  Cooper Lake steppings.  Perhaps those two new entries were just early
	  engineering samples for Kaby Lake.
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(9,14),13 stepping to decode_uarch_intel.  The
	  fallback without a stepping is weak, and it should be avoided for
	  any actual known stepping.  (Added a comment too.)
	* Makefile: Changed my own Todd's Development rules to build on very old
	  systems, so that the executables will run at all on very old systems.
	* Makefile: Changed -Wextra to -W.  That isn't recommended on modern
	  gcc versions, but still works.  And it is necessary on really old
	  gcc versions, because -Wextra produces a hard error.

Sun Feb  2 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Feb  2 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile, cpuid.proto.spec: Added FAMILY.NOTES to the list of files to
	  be included in tarball & rpm doc directory.  That file still is messy,
	  but I reference it a lot, so maybe it will be useful to others too.

Sun Feb  2 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added old (synth) models from sandpile.org: AMD Elan SC400,
	  NSC Geode LX.
	* cpuid.c: Added some old (synth) and (uarch synth) die process numbers
	  from sandpile.org.
	* cpuid.c: Added stepping values from sandpile.org.
	* cpuid.c: sandpile.org calls (0,6),(4,6) "Crystalwell".  Arguably, that
	  is just the name of the L4 cache.  But even Intel's ARK calls these
	  CPUs "Crystal Well".  So I'm changing the name to "Crystal Well".  The
	  uarch still is Haswell, so that should clarify any confusion.
	* cpuid.c: sandpile.org calls (0,6),(4,7) "Brystalwell".  The situation
	  is similar, but Intel does not use that name at all.  I'm not renaming
	  these cores.

Sun Feb  2 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added leaf walking of the 0x20000000 (Intel Phi) range and
	  decoding of a single bit in 0x20000001, based on information in
	  sandpile.org.  I found only a vague hint about this in the Intel Xeon
	  Phi Coprocessor System Developers Guide, but no details.
	* cpuid.c: For the (0,11) family of Phi processors, placing them within
	  a K1OM family.  The (0,6) Phi cores are just Airmont-derived, so left
	  them alone.

Sat Feb  1 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Reverted Cedar Trail back to Cedarview.  (Atom uArch name vs.
	  Core name vs. Platform name vs. SoC name is very confusing.)

Sat Feb  1 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added Broadwell (0,6),(3,13) steppings based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Haswell (0,6),(3,12) steppings based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Haswell-ULT (0,6),(4,5),0 stepping based on Coreboot*.

	* cpuid.c: Added Apollo Lake (0,6),(5,12) A0 stepping based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Gemini Lake (0,6),(7,10) A0 stepping, and corrected
	  R0 stepping, based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Ice Lake-U/Y (0,6),(7,14) A0 stepping based on
	  Coreboot*, and disregarding inconsistent info from spec update.
	* cpuid.c: Added Tiger Lake (0,6),(8,12) A0 stepping based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Elkhart Lake (0,6),(9,6) A0 stepping based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Comet Lake (0,6),(10,6) steppings based on Coreboot*.
	* cpuid.c: Added Comet Lake-H/S (0,6),(10,5) steppings based on
	  Coreboot*.

Sat Feb  1 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added (uarch synth) decoding for (6,15),(0,0) Bulldozer,
	  based on engineering sample.

	  and Toronto, based on instlatx64 samples.
	* cpuid.c: Added (uarch synth) decoding for (8,15),(0,0) Zen, based on
	  engineering sample.
	* cpuid.c: Added Zhaoxin (0,7),(1,15) based on example.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate Zhaoxin ZhangJiang from VIA Isaiah [C7] in
	  (synth) and (uarch synth).  Sadly, this implies a need to use brand
	  information for (uarch synth).
	* cpuid.c: Addedd (synth) for VIA version of Zhaoxin ZhangJaing at
	  (0,7),(0,11).
	* cpuid.c: Added Westmere-EP A0 & B0 stepping (synth) based on instlatx64
	  sample & wikipedia article.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bogus stepping in Centerton fallback (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(5,5),10 Cooper Lake (synth) & (uarch synth),
	  based on Qemu.
	* cpuid.c: Added "AMD PRO A" as a 2nd string to detect AMD A-Series.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate Raven Ridge from Great Horned Owl/
	  Banded Kestrel (synth), based on "Embedded" string in brand.
	* cpuid.c: Added Merlin Falcon as R-Series alternative everywhere
	  G-Series Brown Falcon appears.
	* cpuid.c: Added rules for EPYC Embedded to differentiate (synth) for
	  Snowy Owl and Naples, based on EPYC 3000 series.  Untested, because I
	  have no examples.

Fri Jan 31 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added instlatx64.atw.hu.
	* cpuid.man: Added -l and -s options.

	  (synth) & (uarch synth).

Fri Jan 31 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added Intel Microcode Update Guidance document.
	* cpuid.c: Removed br.generic check from dc (Core) query.  It was useful
	  in the Yonah era, but has been problematic since.  Instead, add a dG
	  (Generic) query and use that where needed for the Yonah CPUs.  And a
	  few other users of dc now use dG.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) for Apollo Lake D0 (collision with B0/B1?) & E0.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized P4500 & U4500 (Arrandale/Clarkdale) (synth) names.

	  in (synth) lines.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified that (0,6),(3,13) is Broadwell-U.
	* cpuid.c: For (0,6),(4,6) (synth), MRG* 2018-08-31 shows stepping 1,
	  so that must be the only known stepping: G0.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Broadwell-Y Core M (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(9,14),11 Coffee Lake Pentium & Celeron (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (0,6),(9,14),11 fallback (synth).

	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (0,6),(8,14),9 Kaby Lake-Y and Amber Lake-Y
	  (synth) with test for -8000 Series in brand name, because there seems
	  to be no other way to tell.
	* cpuid.c: Added XMM 7272 (SoFIA) (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added Coffee Lake R0 Xeon (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added Whiskey Lake W0 Pentium & Celeron (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Correct (8,14) (uarch synth) to just Kaby Lake once all
	  instances of Coffee lake had been eliminated from that family.  The
	  (9,14) family continues to include both Kaby Lake & Coffee Lake.

Fri Jan 31 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added Intel 600827 spec update.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized Bay Trail-M/D (synth) names and expanded them.
	* cpuid.c: Added Bay Trail-M/D D0/D1 (synth).

Thu Jan 30 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added VIA die processes for as many uarchs/cores as I could
	  find.

Wed Jan 29 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added comments about various Intel spec updates.
	* cpuid.man: Removed extra "315593" garbage line.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) for Broadwell-E R0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added stepping number for Apollo Lake B0/B1.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (synth) between Core & Xeon (0,6),(3,15)

	* cpuid.c: Added Zhaoxin LuJiaZiu (0,7),(3,11) model (synth) &
	  (uarch synth).

Tue Jan 28 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (synth) between Bay Trail Pentiums, Celerons
	  & Atoms.
	* cpuid.c: Differentiate (synth) between Braswell Pentiums & Celerons.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (synth) steppings for Braswell.
	* cpuid.c: Add J3000 series to (synth) for Braswell.
	* cpuid.c: Remove Pentium & Celeron items from {Kaby,Coffee,Comet} Lake
	  Core (synth).  I'd already created separate items for those, but
	  missed removing the names from the Core-specific line.

Mon Jan 27 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Mon Jan 27 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed 0x8000001e/ecx to display nodes per processor in N-1
	  notation, after receiving confirmation from AMD that this is correct.

Sat Jan 25 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed spelling of (size synth).  I meant to always have
	  "synth" at the end of synthesized fields, and had that one flipped
	  around.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified AVX512_VNNI: neural network instructions.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified AVX512_VBMI2: byte VPCOMPRESS, VPEXPAND.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified AVX512_BF16: bfloat16 is a data format, not an
	  instruction.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/0/edx md-clear feature, found from Xen & Qemu
	  hypervisors.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000008/ebx ppin feature, found from Xen hypervisor.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x40000001/eax (KVM) flags.
	* cpuid.c: Got rid of the Transmeta 0x80860001/eax family description,
	  which I missed when I got rid of all 1/eax families.  It wasn't so
	  egregious, but it wasn't very valuable either.  The Transmeta Crusoe
	  name already was in the (synth) leaf.
	* cpuid.c: Wrote a version of bits_needed() that uses __builtin_clz
	  with gcc 3.4 and later.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bug with old asm-based bits_needed() function when the
	  input value was 0.

Sat Jan 25 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Further clarified descriptions in 0x8000001f leaf, based on
	  text in AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual, Vol 3, 3.28.  I had
	  missed these new fields in my earlier pass through the manual.
	* cpuid.c: Added comments for more undocumented fields, noting where
	  the information came from, particularly SKC*, LX*, and sandpile.org.
	* cpuid.c: Changed case of new descriptions.
	* cpuid.c: Created Synth_Family() & Synth_Model() macros based on
	  print_1_eax & SKC's AMD_Family() macro.
	* cpuid.c: Added (family synth) and (model synth) to 0x80000001/eax,
	  (AMD and Hygon variants), just like for 1/eax.
	* cpuid.c: Added Castle Peak B0 stepping (synth), now that I know the
	  stepping name.
	* cpuid.c: Changed 0x80000008/ebx "RDPRU instruction" field.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified 0x80000020 leaf descriptions based on AMD 55803 PPR.
	* cpuid.c: Modified print_apic_synth's bit width computations to reflect
	  change in terminology (core => thread, CU => core) in AMD Family 17h.
	* cpuid.man: Updated 54945 PPR name, using newer doc from
	  developer.amd.com.
	* cpuid.man: Added 55803 PPR, found by URL provided by AMD.
	* cpuid.man: Updated sandpile.org URL.

Sat Jan 25 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Selectively applied changes from Smita Koralahalli
	  Channabasappa's patch: "Add PQoS feature to CPUID utility and display
	  subleaf 1 for leaf 0x80000020 in the raw CPUID data."
	* cpuid.c: Renamed fields which no longer are Intel-specific:
	  RDT-CMT/PQoS cache monitoring and RDT-CAT/PQE cache allocation.

Fri Jan 24 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Shortened 0x8000001f leaf descriptions to <= 40 chars.

Fri Jan 24 2020 Smita Koralahalli Channabasappa <Smita.KoralahalliChannabasappa@amd.com>
	* cpuid.c: Add AMD Secure Encryption feature bits to CPUID utility.
	* cpuid.c: Update CPUID utility with additional AMD specific features.
	* cpuid.c: Handle naming issues of cores->threads at register
	  80000008_ecx and compute unit->core at register 8000001e_ebx for
	  families greater than 16h.  Retains previously assigned names if
	  families are lesser than or equal to 16h.  Family values are
	  determined by adding family number and extended family
	  number(80000001_eax[8:11] + 80000001_eax[20:27]) as described in PPR
	  under CPUID_Fn00000001_eax.

Wed Jan 22 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Jan 22 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: In print_80000001_ebx_amd, removed two checks for
	  __M(val_1_eax) >= _XM(0) + _M(0).  Yes, gcc, I know that "comparison
	  of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true", and I also know even a
	  half-assed optimizer will get rid of it, so I preferred clarity.  But
	  people freak out if the compiler emits any warnings, no matter what
	  crazy -W options the've chosen.  So I'm removing them.
	* cpuid.c: Changed a bunch of ccstring return types to cstring.  The
	  extra const in ccstring was meaningless for return types, but it
	  caused a ton of additional -Wignored-qualifiers warnings.  No grousing
	  about those warnings; they seem legit.
	* Makefile: Added -Wextra, so I'll see these before people complain
	  about them in the future.

Tue Jan 21 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed Cannon Lake to Palm Cove when talking about uarch.
	* cpuid.c: Added extra (0,6),(8,14),12 (unknown type) fallback.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed (0,6),(8,14) Whiskey Lake typo.
	* cpuid.c: Added i*-9000 names to (0,6),(9,14) Coffee Lake CPUs.

Mon Jan 20 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Jan 19 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed (synth) decoding of Kaby Lake vs. Coffee Lake (and
	  their myriad "optimizations").
	* cpuid.c: Correctly (synth) decoding of Comet Lake, which was wildly
	  wrong.
	* cpuid.c: Treating Whiskey Lake, Amber Lake, and Comet Lake as distinct
	  uarchs just causes absurd "Coffee Lake / Whiskey Lake / Amber Lake /
	  Comet Lake" uarch strings.  Instead, call all of them Coffee Lake, but
	  turn off the core_is_uarch flag.  This ends up treating the other 3 as
	  core names within the Coffee Lake uarch, which seems clearer.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed Ice Lake to Sunny Cove when talking about uarch.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed Tiger Lake to Willow Cove when talking about uarch.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) differentiation between Whiskey Lake (U line)
	  & and Amber Lake (Y line).
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) differentiation between Whiskey Lake (8000
	  Series) and Comet Lake (10000 Series).
	* cpuid.c: Separated (synth) for Goldmont Plus into Pentium & Celeron.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed Moorefield (synth) to say Z3500 instead of Z3400.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed (0,6),(5,5),7 to Cascade Lake-X.  Core names should be
	  as specific as possible (in contrast to uarch names).
	* cpuid.c: added (0,6),(2,7) Atom Z2000 Medfield (synth) based on
	  example found on instlatx64.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed Cedarview (SoC name) to Cedar Trail (core name).
	* cpuid.c: Added (0,6),(1,15) Havendale/Auburndale (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added VIA (0,6),(0,15) Esther C5J (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added VIA Nano steppings to (synth).
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD Ryzen vs. EPYC (synth) differentiation to
	  Castle Peak / Rome.
	* cpuid.c: Separated Mullins into Mullins (tablets) and Beema (desktop).
	* cpuid.c: Separated Kabini into Kabini (desktop) and Kyoto (servers).
	  Also added Temash for A-Series, although they're all mixed up with
	  Kabini.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD (6,15),(3,8) Godavari (synth) decoding.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD (2,15),(0,3) Griffin (synth) decodings.
	* cpuid.c: Removed duplicate junk code for AMD (1,15),(0,2) which
	  prevented the 3 and 10 steppings from being used.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected some AMD (0,6),(0,8) Duron Applebred (synth) names.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD DG02SRTBP4MFA based on example found on instlatx64.

Fri Jan 17 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Merged 0xb and 0x1f leaf code, much like what Len Brown of
	  Intel suggested a year ago.  I don't know why I didn't just do that in
	  the first place.  Merged field names look more like the 0x1f names,
	  because I thought they were clearer.
	* cpuid.c: Removed type descriptions from "--- level ---" sub-headers.
	  Intel docs clarify the levels and types are not related.
	* cpuid.c: Got rid of the ridiculously overloaded 1/eax family
	  descriptions.  That information is nearly useless in isolation and
	  described much better in the new (uarch synth) field.
	* cpuid.c: Also got rid of 0x80000001/eax family descriptions.  It
	  wasn't nearly as bad, but still better to use the (uarch synth) field.
	* cpuid.c: Because I removed that family information, also updated the
	  decode_uarch* functions with information about older CPU makers'
	  information.
	* cpuid.c: Added vendor name to (uarch synth).
	* cpuid.c: Fixed 4 and 0x8000001d leaf descriptions to say that the
	  values are in "minus 1" notation.  Steven Noonan hinted that there was
	  something to check here, and there was.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth size) field to the 4 and 0x8000001d leaves to
	  compute the cache size, also based on a hint from Steven Noonan.
	* cpuid.c: Added preliminary Zhaoxin decoding based on limited
	  information I could find.
	* cpuid.c: Added missing uarch names to decode_uarch_intel().
	* cpuid.c: Added note about P5 Tillamook CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Added some more die process values.

Thu Jan 16 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Thu Jan 16 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added decode_uarch*() and moved the uarch suffixes there from
	  print_synth*().  print_synth_intel() and print_synth_amd() now call
	  that function to get the suffixes.
	* cpuid.c: Added print_uarch_synth() to display just those suffixes.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for Itanium Poulson & Kittson.
	* cpuid.c: Correct (synth) decoding for Itanium Montecito, Millington,
	  Montvale, Tukwila.
	* cpuid.c: Cleaned up AMD [Excavator] core names.
	* cpuid.man: Added some missing Intel spec updates.

Wed Jan 15 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added "(family synth)" and "(model synth)" to do the combined
	  values used by the linux kernel and AMD.  That is:
	     Family = XF + F
	     Model  = (XM << 4) + M
	* cpuid.c: Hunt down the fallback (synth) decodings that just list tons
	  of different possible meanings, all copied from the more specific
	  lines above them.  They almost always are wrong; if they were right,
	  the more specific tests would've detected them.  So, they're pure
	  guesswork.  Replace them with "(unknown type)", which is more honest.
	* cpuid.c: Simplified Intel Xeon Scalable descriptions.
	* cpuid.c: Eliminated reiteration of i3-XXXX, i5-XXXX, i7-XXXX CPUs,
	  using i*-XXXX instead.
	* cpuid.c: Added (synth) decoding for Core i*-4000U seen in the wild.
	* cpuid.c: Correct missing = symbol in 0x80000001/eax transmeta leaf.
	* cpuid.c: Added [K6], [K7], [K8] (synth) clarifications for AMD K8 CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Added (6,15),(6,5) (synth) based on sample from Alexandros
	  Couloumbis.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD "*-Series" queries for the various latters and
	  (synth) rules to use them.  Added more rules for AMD architectures
	  that used this nomenclature.
	* cpuid.c: Changed dO query to sO.

Wed Jan 15 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified (synth) for each microarchitecture to include
	  process-neutral microarchitecture names too:
	  {P6}           = (Pentium Pro, Klamath, Deschutes, Katmai, Coppermine,
	                    Tualatin, Mendocino, Cascades)
	  {Netburst}     = [Willamette, Northwood, Prescott, Cedar Mill]
	  {P6 Pentium M} = (Banias), [Dothan, Yonah]
	  {Core}         = [Merom, Penryn]
	  {Nehalem}      = [Nehalem, Westmere]
	  {Sandy Bridge} = (Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge)
	  {Haswell}      = (Haswell, Broadwell)
	  {Skylake}      = (Skylake, Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake, Whiskey Lake,
	                    Amber Lake, Cascade Lake, Comet Lake, Cooper Lake,
	                    Cannon Lake)
	  {Sunny Cove}   = (Ice Lake, Tiger Lake)
	  The similarities are hazy in places.  But this seems useful to help
	  people who, for example, don't know "Cedar Mill", but do know
	  "Netburst".  Also the number of Skylake-related architecture names
	  exploded, and not all "Lake" names belong to Skylake, so this helps to
	  clarify.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected (synth) for Tolapai to 90nm process.

Tue Jan 14 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified Arrandale & Clarkdale as [Westmere].
	* cpuid.c: Clarified Bloomfield, Gainestown & Beckton as [Nehalem].
	* cpuid.c: Added [Merom] clarification to a couple CPUs that missed it.
	* cpuid.c: Added [Cedar Mill] clarification to a couple CPUs that missed
	  it.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified Dothan, Stealey, Crofton & Tolopai as [Dothan].
	* cpuid.c: Clarified Yonah, Sossaman as [Yonah].
	* cpuid.c: Did not clarify Banias as [Banias] because it appears there
	  are no non-Banias chips based on it.
	* cpuid.man: Added handy wiki pages about microarchitectures.

Mon Jan 13 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 6/eax HW_FEEDBACK flag.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/0/ecx ENQCMD flag.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/0/edx AVX512_VP2INTERSECT flag.
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/1/eax AVX512_BF16 flag.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0xd/0/eax flags for CET_U & CET_S state.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000008/ebx WBNOINVD flag.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000008/ebx SSBD flags from AMD white paper.
	* cpuid.c: In 7/0/edx leaf, clarified PCONFIG as an instruction.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth detection for Cyrix MediaGX (circa 1997 SoC).
	* cpuid.c: Added 7/0/ecx TME flag, discovered in the linux-5.5-rc6
	  kernel source.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x80000008/ebx additional STIBP always on flag,
	  discovered in the linux-5.5-rc6 kernel source.
	* cpuid.man: Added AMD SSBD white paper.
	* cpuid.man: Added linux kernel note and clue on what to look for.

Sun Jan 12 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added Matisse B0 stepping based on sample from Steven Noonan.
	* cpuid.c: Removed redundant dR lines from Pinnacle Ridge.  (They could
	  come back if I see an EPYC based on Pinnacle Ridge, but they're
	  redundant now.)

Sun Jan 12 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Jan 12 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile, cpuid.proto.spec: Added INSTALL_STRIP to allow disabling the
	  install -s option.  This makes rpmbuild & find-debuginfo.sh happy,
	  because they can find the cpuid debug information and create the
	  cpuid-debuginfo rpm.
	* Makefile: Updated release target to move debugsource rpms too.

Sun Jan 12 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x40000004 leaf for Xen hypervisor.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x40000005 leaf for Xen hypervisor.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed errors with static ccstring arrays that were not large
	  enough to hold NULLs for all reserved bit field values.
	* cpuid.c: Added AMD's CMT "compute unit" concept to print_apic_synth
	  by adding that architectural level above the "cores" level, which
	  relects AMD's portrayal.  This level is displayed only if it is
	  present.
	* cpuid.c: Added some undocumented synth decodings found on
	  https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/cpuid.  Not everything there makes
	  sense, so I didn't take everything.  Marked with comments.
	* cpuid.c: Added architecture tags to Intel synth decodings:
	  [Willamette], [Northwood], [Prescott], [Merom], [Penryn], [Nehalem],
	  [Westmere].  After that, Intel dropped the hyper-specific code names
	  in favor of suffix letters.
	* cpuid.c: Added architecture tags to Intel synth decodings: [Bonnell],
	  [Saltwell], [Silvermont], [Airmont], [Goldmont], [Goldmont Plus].
	  Intel continues to use hyper-specific names for Atom CPUs.

Sat Jan 11 2020 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Added -Wimplicit-fallthrough -Wunused-parameter options.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified 4/edx WBINV/INVD flag.
	* cpuid.c: Added new 7/edx flags, especially including new features to
	  mitigate speculative execution exploits.
	* cpuid.c: Cleaned up output of 0x10 subleaves.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x12/0/ebx CPINFO for #CP exceptions in enclave.
	* cpuid.c: Properly display 0x18 sub-leaf number.
	* cpuid.c: Added leaf 0x1f V2 Topology logic to decode_mp_synth() and
	  print_apic_synth().  I have no physical examples, so I only could test
	  with artificial input files.
	* cpuid.c: Added 3-way and 6-way associativity to 0x80000006 and
	  0x80000019 leaves.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed incorrect fallthrough in switch for "41322 3.74:
	  table 16".
	* cpuid.c: Fixed incorrect fallthrough's in switch for Family 12h tables.
	* cpuid.c: Added UNUSED macro to make newer gcc's shut up about unused
	  formals.  (They have one complaint if the name is omitted, and another
	  complaint if it's specified but unused.  There's just no pleasing gcc.)
	* cpuid.c: Added break after usage() to make gcc shut up about a
	  nonexistent fallthrough (even though it was marked with NOTREACHED).
	* cpuid.c: Added missing newlines to all the print_2_byte Cyrix/VIA
	  special cases.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed print_f_0_edx: QoS monitoring was in 0xf/0 bit 1, not

	  now.

Fri Mar  3 2017 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added missing SDBG bit to 1/ecx leaf.

Sun Jan 22 2017 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Use __cpuid_count macro for "cpuid" instruction if possible.
	  This macro is present in gcc 4.3.0 and later, and works around the fact
	  that the cpuid instruction writes on the PIC register.  This is only
	  important when compiling PIC/PIE.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Knights Landing B0.  The Intel
	  docs still don't specify the stepping numbers, but all examples seen
	  so far have stepping number 1, and so far B0 is the only stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added new synth decodings for Intel Kaby Lake.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed synth decodings for AMD Steamroller.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed synth decodings for AMD Jaguar.

	  and report it as Vishera instead of Abu Dhabi/Seoul/Delhi.
	* cpuid.c: Added general microarchitecure names for AMD (e.g.
	  Piledriver) in addition to specific core names (e.g. Trinity) for
	  later generation processors.  If I have trouble remembering these,
	  it seems likely other people do too.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Quark X1000.
	* cpuid.c: Added Intel Atom Z2760 (Clover Trail).
	* cpuid.c: Added extra synth decodings for some Sandy Bridge processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added extra synth decodings for some Ivy Bridge processors.
	* cpuid.man: Added new & missing spec updates & revision guides.
	* FUTURE: Cleaned this up somewhat.

	* cpuid.c: Removed stale len variable from do_file().

Thu Dec  1 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Nov 30 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bugs in the subleaf walks for 0x8000001d (AMD cache
	  information) and 0x40000003 (Xen hypervisor information) because the
	  code for them was under wholly the wrong loops.  Thanks to Brice
	  Goglin for detecting this and working out the cause of the bug.

Wed Nov 16 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>

Sun Nov 13 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed bug reported by Andrew Cooper where, in do_real, for
	  the 0xd leaf, the lower half of the valid bit set for XSS should've
	  used 0xd/1/ecx instead of 0xd/1/eax.  Sadly, this bug affects raw
	  dumps too.
	* cpuid.c: Added -l/--leaf and -s/--subleaf options to cause cpuid
	  to dump just the specified leaf and subleaf.  If -s/--subleaf is not
	  specified, it is assumed to be 0.  The intended purpose for this is
	  to display raw dumps of not-yet-supported leaves, or to workaround
	  bugs like the above.

Sat Nov 12 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: In bits_needed, add a further check for !defined(__ILP32__),
	  which should help with building a 32-bit version of cpuid on a 64-bit
	  system.

Sat Nov 12 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Made editorial changes to Piotr Luc's patches (spelling,

	  its stepping number isn't documented.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for (0,6),(8,14) Kaby Lake processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Apollo Lake processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added vague synth decoding for (0,6),(9,14) Kaby Lake
	  processors.

	* Made new release.
	* Makefile: Added clean rules to remove tarballs & rpm's with other
	  version numbers.

Sun Aug 14 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuinfo2cpuid: Added a script that takes input from a /proc/cpuinfo
	  file and converts it into suitable input to cpuid.  The information
	  that cpuid is capable of producing based on this very limited input
	  information is slight, but apparently there is interest in getting the
	  synthesized (synth) leaf from this.  There isn't much value in using
	  it with an actual /proc/cpuinfo file on the local system, because just
	  allowing cpuid to read the local cpuid info will provide better
	  output.  But it could be useful for interpreted saved /proc/cpuinfo
	  files from another system.  I slapped together the basic logic, and
	  Jirka Hladky turned it into a proper perl script, with actual options,
	  a help screen, and even documentation.  I then made some changes to
	  give it some more uniform indentation, whitespace, and such.  And to
	  give Jirka Hladky more credit, since his contribution to the script is
	  larger than my own.
	* Makefile: Added rules to generate cpuinfo2cpuid.man from the =pod data
	  in the script.
	* Makefile: Added cpuinfo2cpuid & cpuinfo2cpuid.man to the released
	  materials.
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Added cpuinfo2cpuid & cpuinfo2cpuid.1.gz to released
	  materials.

Sun Aug 14 2016 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed instances of Kb to KB.  In print_2_meaning, changed
	  an instance of 4k to 4K.

	  into their component parts.  Also added IA32_XSS PT state.
	* cpuid.c: In print_d_n_ecx, clarify XCR0 as user state and IA32_CXX as
	  supervisor state.
	* cpuid.c: In print_d_n, add MPX and PT features.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed leaf 0x10 to Intel's new name.  Corrected totally
	  bogus interpretation of subleaf 0.

	  provide new Intel correct names for each.
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x14/0 PTWRITE & power event trace.
	* cpuid.c: Added description for leaf 0x12 (SGX Capability) and all its
	  subleaves.
	* cpuid.c: Added descriptionf or leaf 0x17 (SoC vendor) and its
	  subleaves.
	* cpuid.c: Decode new leaf 2 cache descriptors: 0x64 & 0xc4.
	* cpuid.c: Updated Atom C2000 (Avoton) with A0/A1 steppings.
	* cpuid.c: Added Atom Z3n00 (Bay Trail-T B2/B3) specific stepping 1.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon D-1500 (Broadwell-DE) V2 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Atom Z8000 (Cherry Trail) with correct model, per
	  changes in its spec update.
	* cpuid.c: Change the (0,6),(5,14) Skylake descriptions to be more vague
	  to reflect the larger set of existing processors now.
	* cpuid.c: Add actual information for the (0,6),(4,14) Skylake
	  processors.

	  processors.
	* cpuid.c: Add actual information for the (0,6),(4,15) Broadwell and
	  Broadwell-EX processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added vague mentions of Goldmont (0,6),(5,12) and (0,6),(5,15)
	  based on 325462 Table 35-1.
	* cpuid.c: Add Atom S1200 (Centerton) under (0,6),(3,6) thanks to an
	  example provided by Jirka Hladky.
	* cpuid.c: Added Eden to the list of possible meanings of VIA
	  (0,6),(6,13).  An example provided by Daniel Wyatt shows that they

	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.man: Added 325462 manual.
	* cpuid.c: Added new & missing decodings for: 4/ecx, 6/eax, 7/ebx, 7/ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Overhauled handling of 0xd leaf, based on new and more
	  extensive information in the Intel CPUID documentation, particularly
	  on how to decide which leaves are valid.  The approach functions
	  correctly for the subset described in the AMD documentation, too.
	  This overhaul includes information on the XSAVEC, XGETBV, and
	  XSAVES/XRSTORS instructions.
	* cpuid.c: Renamed 0xf leaves to include "Monitoring".
	* cpuid.c: Added 0x10 leaves for QoS Enforcement.
	* cpuid.c: Added new leaf 2 cache meanings: 0x1d, 0x24, 0xa0, 0xc3.
	* cpuid.c: Added missing i7 synth decoding for (0,6),(3,14).
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Atom Z3000 model & stepping which were bafflingly
	  wrong: (0,6)(3,5),1 -> (0,6)(3,7),8.

	  N and J series.
	* cpuid.man: Added references to a bunch of new Intel manuals.

	  D0 (it was omitted accidentally).

Fri Mar 21 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Deal with 0-width PKG_width fields in print_apic_synth(),
	  for CPUs where the SMT_width + CORE_width >= 8.  This happens on
	  Xeon Phi chips.

	* Makefile: Added src_tar rule.

Tue Feb 11 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Made changes to allow building and running on kFreeBSD.  This
	  started out as a patch from Andrey Rahmatullin, but I refactored it.
	  The changes to disable the cpuid kernel support are protected by a
	  USE_CPUID_MODULE definition.  And there's an additional sanity check
	  to reject -k in that case.  The changes to use the library versions of
	  sched_setaffinity are protected by USE_KERNEL_SCHED_SETAFFINITY.  I
	  continue to go straight to the kernel on linux, though.

Tue Feb 11 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Reorganized Andrey Rahmatullin's changes a bit and used
	  them in my development build rules (make todd) too.

Tue Feb 11 2014 Andrey Rahmatullin <wrar@wrar.name>
	* Makefile: Honor CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS from the environment.

Mon Jan 27 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Change to my development build rules (make todd) to use ld's
	  --hash-style=both to avoid a SIGFPE when running on very old 32-bit
	  systems.  It has no effect on the tool for anyone else.

Thu Jan 23 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Thu Jan 23 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Stop displaying raw hex for 0xc and 0xe leaves, because they
	  are reserved and just contain zeroes.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed missing leaf 0xf subleaf 1 in do_real().
	* cpuid.man: Added reference to Intel Architecture Instruction Set
	  Extensions Programming Reference (319433).
	* cpuid.c: Added new feature flags from that document.

Sun Jan 12 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Jan 12 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron B800 synth decoding.
	* cpuid.c: Added Pentium G3000 & Celeron G1800 synth decoding.
	* cpuid.c: Added 4th Gen Core family mobile processors synth decoding.

	  engineering samples) and related Ivy Bridge-EP processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added Bay Trail (Atom Z3000, etc.) processors synth decoding.

Sun Jan 12 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.man: Added reference to Intel decoding from Intel 64 and IA-32
	  Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 2A: Instruction Set
	  Reference, A-M (253666).
	* cpuid.c: Added new Intel decodings from that document.

Sun Jan 12 2014 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added new (instruction supported synth) field to report on
	  instruction support when knowledge of that is scattered across
	  multiple CPUID leaves.  PREFETCH/PREFETCHW is the weirdest example.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified the raw PREFETCH/PREFETCHW field in 80000001 edx
	  leaf with the 3DNow! prefix, similar to the description in the AMD
	  CPUID docs.  Thanks to Chris Orgill for reporting these two issues.

Fri Sep 27 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added missing break to decode_amd_model(), family (0,15),
	  model (4,0), case 0x18.  Thanks to David Binderman for reporting this.

Mon Jun 10 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Mon Jun 10 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added mention of Opteron 3200 (Zurich) chips, accidentally
	  omitted from yesterday's updates.

Sun Jun  9 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sun Jun  9 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated 14h Model 00h-0Fh AMD model tables.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Opteron x300 (Piledriver) chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for family 16h processors, tentatively
	  identified as Steamroller.
	* cpuid.man: Added new AMD 15h Model 10h-1Fh, and AMD 16h Model 00h-0Fh
	  manuals.

Sat Jun  8 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added sanity check to 0xCxxxxxxx leaves to check for an
	  unreasonably large indicated maximum leaf number.  If found, further
	  walk of them is halted.
	* cpuid.c: Skip 0x4xxxxxxx leaves if cpuid does not indicate that the
	  environment is a guest.  This was suggested by Steven Levine, although
	  I implemented it differently.

Sat Jun  8 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Clarified some KVM hypervisor leaf feature flags that Eduardo
	  Habkost pointed out.  Added a couple new flags.

Sat Jun  8 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Extended Eduardo Habkost's stash separation to include the
	  0x80000008 leaf, and the leaves that inform transmeta_info.

Sat Jun  8 2013 Eduardo Habkost <ehabkost@raisama.net>
	* cpuid.c: This patch separates the code that changes fields in the
	  'stash' struct from the code that prints that information. This way,
	  the stash struct will get updated even when in raw mode, so other
	  parts of the code can use that information.
	  [NOTE FROM Todd Allen: It used to be that the stash was only set and
	  used in cooked mode, but some uses dealing with the hypervisor snuck
	  out and were used all the time.  This new separation is only really
	  necessary for the hypervisor fields, but it's good practice to do all
	  the fields this way, so I'm accepting the patch as is.]

Sat Jun  8 2013 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Celeron G400/G500.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Cedarview B3.

	  900/1000/2000/2100.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified that Ivy Bridge Xeon E3-1200 is actually E3-1200 v2.
	* cpuid.c: Added vague synth decoding for Haswell, but spec updates
	  show no specific chips or steppings yet.
	* cpuid.c: Expanded A100/A110 synth decoding to include semi-official
	  Pentium M (Crofton) processors in Apple TV boxes.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon E5-2600 v2 engineering sample.  Perhaps this will
	  be the final synth decoding for them, but for now it's just marked as
	  an engineering sample.
	* cpuid.man: Added new Intel manuals.

Fri Aug 24 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added sanity check to 0x4xxxxxxx leaves to check for an
	  unrecognized hypervisor and an unreasonably large indicated maximum
	  leaf number.  If found, further walk of them is halted.

Tue Aug 21 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Cleaned up printf(name) statements that were admonished by
	  clang.

Fri Jun  1 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Thu May 31 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated CPUID feature flags.
	* cpuid.c: Updated CPUID function 7 to support sub-leaves (mostly for
	  future functionality that might be added to them).
	* cpuid.c: Updated synth decoding for Intel Dothan C0 because some use
	  65nm process now.
	* cpuid.c: Updated Intel EP80579 synth to mention 65nm process.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Atom E600 series.
	* cpuid.c: Updated synth decoding for Intel Sandy Bridge D2 to include J1
	  and Q0, which have the same CPUID.

	* cpuid.c: Fixed some formatting bugs for Transmeta-specific leaves.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for some of VIA's versions of WinChips.
	* cpuid.man: Added mentions of spec updates for several Atoms, i7 for
	  LGA-2011, and Xeon E5; and AMD 12h family.

Wed May 30 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed ancient bug in distinguishing Irwindale from Nocona
	  (they differ only by L2 cache size).
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for desktop and mobile Ivy Bridge.

Sat Feb 25 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Cleaned up hypervisor-specific leaves for KVM.
	* cpuid.man: Added mention of KVM cpuid documentation.

Fri Feb 24 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Intel Westmere-EX processors.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for AMD family 15h chips: AMD FX
	  (Zambezi), Opteron 6200 (Interlagos), and Opteron 4200 (Valencia).
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for AMD Z-Series and other Fusion
	  chip ON-C0 steppings.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Atom Z600 (Lincroft).
	* cpuid.c: Updated AMD model decoding for family 10h processors.
	* cpuid.man: Added mention of AMD family 14h and 15h documents, and
	  Intel Westmere-EX & Lincroft documents.
	* cpuid.man: Removed obsolete limitation about 0x8000001b.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for hypervisor leaves (0x4000000 and after).
	  Interpreted known generic leaves.  Interpreted hypervisor-specific
	  leaves for Xen (deduced from source, as no documentation on them
	  exists).  Interpreted hypervisor-specific leaves for KVM.  Interpreted
	  hypervisor-specific leaves for Microsoft.

Tue Jan  3 2012 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added synth decoding for Athlon 64 (Venice DH-E6) chips.

Wed Nov  2 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added saw_4 and saw_b stash flags to deal with chips that
	  report 0xc codes but still omit 0xb codes.  This way, a maximum code
	  of 0xc no longer implies the presence of 0xb codes for things like
	  APIC decoding.

Mon Mar 28 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added APIC synth decoding for AMD, deduced by analogy to Intel
	  code and the multiprocessor synth logic.

Mon Mar  7 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added some decoding for VIA 0xc0000002 codes, based on
	  information from Juerg Haefliger.  Very incomplete because VIA
	  doesn't document their functions well.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed output of 0xc0000001 raw dump to conform to new style.

Sat Mar  5 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Fri Mar  4 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added Celeron T1000 series, previously missing.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added Celeron Mobile P4000, U3000 series.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added current Sandy Bridge processors.

Thu Mar  3 2011 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added detection of PCIDs & TSC-DEADLINE.
	* cpuid.c: Verified Mike Stroyan CPUID 2 cache meanings from Intel CPUID
	  document (241618-037).  Added 0x76 meaning.
	* cpuid.c: Added various new flags from Intel 241618-037.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added AMD family 14h processors.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Updated Intel process id table, mostly as just
	  generalizations.

Tue Nov  9 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Update the usage() screen, since some of its -i and -1
	  comments are incorrect now.

Mon Oct  4 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added AMD Geode LX.
	* cpuid.c: Added NSC Geode GX2 and AMD Geode GX.
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added AMD Geode NX.

Sat Oct  2 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added Intel Atom N500.

Thu Sep 30 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added support for Intel Tolapai (SoC).
	* cpuid.c,cpuid.man: Added support for Intel Clarkdale chips from
	  specification update 323179.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized decode_amd_model by adding full brand tables for
	  AMD chips.  If a BIOS doesn't recognize a chip it writes
	  "model unknown" into its brand string via MSR's.
	  decode_override_brand detects that and uses the decode_amd_model brand
	  to differentiate CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected 80000001/ebx PkgType, BrandId, and str1 bit fields.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected problems with brand field decoding because its bit
	  field with differs from architecture to architecture.
	* cpuid.c: decode_amd_model: the partialmodel decrement special case
	  applies only to XF=1,F=15; and not to XF=2,F=15.

Mon Sep 27 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added support for NSC/AMD Geode GX1.

Wed Sep  8 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected the Transmeta processor revisions, which should've
	  been in hex instead of octal.

Thu Sep  2 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added a couple vague steppings for Transmeta Efficeon TM8000
	  processors.  Updated some transmeta bitfields.  This is all done
	  blind, as I have no examples of these chips, little documentation, and
	  the company is long defunct.

Thu Sep  2 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed a few header strings that had incorrect function hex
	  codes or registers.

Wed Sep  1 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed buffer size in do_file() to be able to read new
	  raw dumps with ecx information.  It needed a couple more characters.
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron M (Yonah D0) & Celeron M (Merom-L1 A1) synth
	  entries.
	* cpuid.c: added Xeon Processor LV (Sossaman D0).
	* cpuid.c: Update Itanium chips in the synth tables.  Sadly, this all
	  still is being done blind, as I have no access to any Itanium chips.
	* cpuid.c: Wrote an x86_64 counterpart to the assembly code for
	  bits_needed().
	* Makefile, cpuid.proto.spec: Changed to support building for both i386
	  and x86_64.

Tue Aug 31 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Rearranged synth rules and substantially simplified query
	  macros into something like the form I was hoping for when I started
	  this redesign.
	* cpuid.c: Added changes from the new AMD CPUID document that claims to
	  have been released in September 2010!
	* cpuid.c: Changed raw dump to include %ecx values to accomodate CPUID
	  functions with gaps in the useful %ecx range (e.g. 0xd).  The file
	  parser accepts either the old or new forms.
	* Makefile, cpuid.proto.spec: Updated build scheme for my current
	  systems.
	* LICENSE: Changed to a GPL license.

Mon Aug 30 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Semi-mechanically eliminated the codes used to
	  disambiguate in the synth string and replaced them with queries,
	  which I think will be more general-purpose and will allow me to
	  eliminate a lot of the problem with codes appropriate for one
	  model being a problem for subsequent models (e.g. the Core Solo
	  vs. Core Duo distinction).  There still are general-purpose
	  queries like there were general-purpose codes, but the
	  special-case queries will only matter for those families that
	  care about them.  This does mean that it's possible for multiple
	  queries to register as true, so I have to be more careful with
	  the order of chips in the synth tables.

Fri Aug 27 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Tested on a variety of CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Mobile Turion checking in decode_brand.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entries for 6/15/4 pre-production
	  Conroe B0/Woodcrest B0.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entries for Santa Rosa F3 stepping
	  (undocumented).
	* cpuid.c: Fixed synth entries for Brisbane, Toledo, and Windsor to
	  expect code DA (for dual-core Athlons).
	* cpuid.c: Generalized the check for Intel Extreme Edition chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entries Core 2 Quad (Conroe) chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth entry for VIA 6/13/0 chip.  Unfortunately, there
	  is no documentation and very little anecdotal evidence of this chip,
	  so the description is vague.
	* cpuid.c: Added addition CPUID function 2 cache codes from Mike
	  Stroyan.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed some cut&paste errors that had EAX where it should
	  have been EBX, as reported by Mike Stroyan
	* cpuid.c: Added very short synth table for SiS chips.  I found no
	  documentation on these, so I just have the one case.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed the (synth) strings for oddball chips, which suffered
	  from a cut&paste error.
	* cpuid.c: Simplified some of the fallback strings that had grown
	  ridiculously long.

Thu Aug 26 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Tested on a variety of CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Added more logic for Woodcrest pre-production chips.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected synth logic for VIA Antaur chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added synth for plain vanilla Thoroughbred Athlon.

Wed Aug 25 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Tested on a variety of CPUs.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed a couple bugs with decoding processor numbers in
	  print_synth_amd_model.

Tue Aug 24 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Further changes to mp_synth decoding, including tracking
	  of the decoding method used (there are around 4 major approaches,
	  depending on how you count).
	* cpuid.c: Added apic_synth decoding to find the appropriate field
	  widths and decode the process local APIC physical ID.  This is useful
	  in its own right, but also helps convince me that many Intel chips
	  really do claim to have hyperthreads even though they don't.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for direct instruction (-i) functionality to
	  report on all CPUs by calling sched_setaffinity to reschedule the
	  process on each CPU.  This is now the default behavior for -i, but
	  it can be overridden with the -1 option.
	* cpuid.c: added Barcelona B1 (undocumented chip) synth decoding.

Mon Aug 23 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Made real_get pass the requested ecx values even when
	  using -k.  Modern linux kernel expect the ecx values in the upper
	  32 bits of the file offset (i.e. lseek64).
	* cpuid.c: Worked out a fallback for determining mp_synth information
	  for Intel chips which lack CPUID function 4.
	* cpuid.c: Added mechanism for determining mp_synth information from
	  CPUID function 11 information if it's available (because if it's
	  present on Intel chips, it's the only reliable way; the older
	  mechanisms return gibberish).

Fri Aug 20 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added to synth even more Nehalem chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added 6/15 model for VIA Nano, but there's very little
	  detailed information on this chip, so that's it.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected some AMD codename confusion from 2006:
	  Dublin->ClawHammer/Odessa, Sonora->Dublin,
	  Palermo(mobile)->Georgetown/Sonora, Lancaster->Lancaster/Richmond,
	  Richmond->Taylor/Trinidad.
	* cpuid.c: Overhauled the AMD model dumping code to understand new
	  families.
	* cpuid.c: Tweaked decode_mp_synth to use ApicIdCoreIdSize, per AMD's
	  CPUID recommendations.

Thu Aug 19 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for Intel Xeons.
	* cpuid.c: Removed all the "How to distinguish" comments, since
	  it seems to be very common for Intel to have indistinguishable
	  processors nowadays (the old cache-checking tricks are unreliable
	  now).
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added to synth additional Nehalem chips as I'm
	  able to hunt them down.

Wed Aug 18 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for Intel Core 2, Atom,
	  Celeron, and Pentium chips based on the same cores.

Tue Aug 17 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for AMD family 10h (K10)
	  and family 11h processors.
	* cpuid.c: simplified print_x_synth_amd by pruning its table down to
	  just the three families that differ from normal 1/eax simple synth,
	  and falling back on 1/eax simple synth otherwise.

Mon Aug 16 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added new steppings to synth tables using latest spec
	  updates for all AMD processor families already in them.
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Updated synth tables for AMD family 0Fh (K8)
	  processors.

Fri Aug 13 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Updated raw data dump based on latest CPUID documentation
	  from Intel & AMD.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed dump of function 4 to iterate over all caches.

Thu Aug 12 2010 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Reorganized synth tables to always use extended family
	  and extended model numbers since they are so prevalent on modern
	  chips.
	* cpuid.c: Added new steppings to synth tables using latest spec
	  updates for all Intel processor families already in them.

Sun Nov 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Core 2 Extreme Edition from brand string.
	  Thanks to Tony Freitas for explaining that Ennnn means desktop while
	  Xnnnn means Extreme Edition for those processors.

Wed Nov 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Itanium2 Montecito C2.
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Core 2 Duo Mobile (Conroe B2).
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Quad-Core Xeon Processor 5300 (Woodcrest B3)
	  and Intel Core 2 Extreme Quad-Core Processor QX6700 (Woodcrest B3).
	* cpuid.c: Recognize Intel Celeron D Processor 36x (Cedar Mill D0).
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish Core 2 Duo from Core 2 Extreme Edition based on
	  presence or absence of hyperthreading.  Thanks to Tony Seacow for
	  providing output for numerous processors and the advice about
	  hyperthreading.

Thu Nov  2 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Changed "number of logical CPU cores - 1" to "number of CPU
	  cores - 1".

Sun Sep 17 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Made the cpuid instruction (-i, --inst options) the default.
	* cpuid.c: Added -k, --kernel option to cause the kernel module to be
	   used.
	* cpuid.c: Removed confusing CPU number from output when using
	  the cpuid instruction.
	* cpuid.man: Updated with new options.
	* cpuid.c, Makefile: Changed i386 _llseek kludge to workaround
	  offsets >= 0x80000000.  Now using -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 in the
	  Makefile instead.  This should allow the i386 cpuid to work on
	  an x86_64 system.
	* cpuid.c: Added knowledge of CPU modules to synthesized field: Tulsa,
	  Woodcrest B1 (pre-production)
	* cpuid.c: In synthesized model field, properly distinguish between
	  Intel Pentium D Processor 8x0 and Intel Pentium Extreme Edition
	  Processor 840 (both Smithfields).
	* cpuid.man: Added mention of new 7100 series spec updates.
	* cpuid.spec: Changed Copyright to License.

Thu Aug 23 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Removed unnecessary one_cpu argument from do_file.
	* cpuid.c: Added -v option to display version number.

Wed Aug 23 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Tue Aug 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c, cpuid.man: Added -i option to use the CPUID instruction
	  directly instead of the CPUID kernel module.
	* cpuid.c: Change Pentium Processor 9x0 to 9xx because of 9x5
	  processors.
	* cpuid.man: Updated information about determining synthesized model
	  information, and added information about determining synthesized
	  multiprocessor information.

Mon Aug  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Change URL to cpuid-specific page.

Sun Aug  6 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Sat Aug  5 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added support for differentiating Core 2 Duo CPUs from Xeon
	  5100 CPUs based on the brand string.
	* cpuid.c: Clarified that CPUID 4 ECX contains one less than the
	  number of sets.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 5 ecx & edx.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 6 ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Added support for CPUID 0xa eax & ebx.
	* cpuid.c: Made CPUID functions 7, 8, and 9 reserved (i.e. say nothing
	  until and unless they are defined).
	* cpuid.c: Corrected CPUID 1 ecx xTPR disabnle.

Wed Aug  2 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Corrected bug with Core 2 Duo recognition.
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish between Allendale and Conroe cores based on
	  L2 cache size.
	* cpuid.c: Added VIA C7 & C7-M names to Esther WinChip C5J core CPUs.
	* cpuid.man: Mention wikipedia pages for CPUs.

Tue Aug  1 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: On help screen, clarified that -f option reads output from
	  -r option.
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Used %{} macros for external command invocations.

Mon Jul 31 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Makefile: Removed install -o 0 -g 0 options.  For installations
	  from the tarball, the user will have to be root anyway.  And for
	  rpm, the %defattr() attribute in the spec is handling this more
	  cleanly.  Finally, those options are causing some non-root
	  installations to have to be done by the root user, which is
	  undesirable.
	* cpuid.c: Improved identification for VIA C3 (Samuel WinChip C5A core).
	* cpuid.c: Loosened up check for "Mobile AMD Athlon(tm) XP" by
	  removing "-M" suffix.
	* cpuid.c: Recognize mobile Athlon XP (Thoroughbred).

Sun Jul 30 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "deterministic cache parameters (4)", so that its
	  children aren't staggered.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected Venice and Palermo processors with DH-E3 and
	  DH-E6 steppings that had been reported as Toledo processors
	  incorrectly.
	* cpuid.c: Corrected codename for the Athlon Thoroughbred's Duron
	  counterpart: Applebred.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish Athlon XP Thortons from Bartons,
	  based on L2 cache size.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish Athlon 64 X2 Manchester E6 from
	  Athlon 64 X2 Toledo.
	* cpuid.c: Added Celeron Yonah C0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Core Yonah D0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon Nocona R0 / Irwindale R0 stepping.
	* cpuid.c: Added Pentium 4 Cedar Mill C1, Pentium D Presler C1, and
	  Xeon Dempsey C1.
	* cpuid.c: Added Xeon Woodcrest B2.
	* cpuid.c: Added Core 2 Conroe B1 & B2 & Core 2 Extreme Processor B1 &
	  B2.
	* cpuid.c: Updated Itanium2 processors.
	* cpuid.man: Added Intel specification updates for new CPUs.

Wed Jul 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: In decode_brand, added check for "Athlon(TM) XP", equivalent
	  to "Athlon(tm) XP".
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "80000002" typo in print_80860002_eax().

Mon Jul 24 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Distinguish properly between Core Solo, Core Duo, and
	  Xeon Processor LV.  Reorganized multi-processor decoding to
	  support that.

Sun Jul 23 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed emission of raw values for cpuid code 2.
	* cpuid.c: Added -f file option to read raw hexadecimal input from a
	  file and parse it instead of executing the cpuid instruction, and
	  code reorganization to support this.

Mon May 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Fixed "unrecogninzed" typo in error.

Fri Apr  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.proto.spec: Added %defattr so that the files in the rpm's are
	  owned by "root" and not "todd".  (Why did no one scream bloody murder
	  about this before?)

Mon Apr  3 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Added code to distinguish between the two different Dual-Core
	  Xeon (Paxville A0) and Dual-Core Xeon Processor 7000 (Paxville A0).
	  Empirically, the significant differences are the VMX flag and the
	  "execution disable" flag.  The VMX flag is in an Intel-defined
	  CPUID function, so it's used.  Thanks to Jason Nicholls for providing
	  the Dual-Core Xeon (Paxville A0) output that made this possible.
	* cpuid.c: Added detection for Xeon Processor LV (Sossaman C0).

Mon Mar 13 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed code that distinguished processors based on
	  presence or absence of L3 cache.  Some of the cache codes weren't
	  being recognized as L3 cache.

Sun Feb 26 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.

Wed Feb 22 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Added VMX: virtual machine extensions to CPUID function 1,
	  register ecx.
	* cpuid.c: Added SVM LBR virtualization to CPUID function 8000000a,
	  register edx.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed cut & paste header error in print_8000000a_eax.

Tue Feb 21 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* cpuid.c: Renamed "hyper-threading technology" field to
	  "hyper-threading / multi-core supported" to eliminate some confusing
	  situations, such as Northwood chips which nominally support hyper-
	  threading, but where it is disabled in the chip; or where hyper-
	  threading is disabled in the BIOS; or AMD multi-core chips, which
	  indicate TRUE here, but all of which lack hyper-threading at present.
	* cpuid.c: Updated family 15 description, which had grown very stale.
	* cpuid.c: Generalized Intel Pentium D Processor 900 to 9x0.
	* cpuid.c: Added Processor Number info to Smithfield processors.

Wed Feb  8 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Use defined(i386) instead of __LONG_MAX__ to determine
	  whether or not it's necessary to use _llseek().  Fixes handling of
	  functions >= 2**31 on some build systems, like the one I used to
	  build the binary rpm.  (D'oh!)  And also indirectly affects the
	  (synth) field.
	* cpuid.c: Fix a busted error check in read_reg() that caused it to
	  return success if the read() failed and quiet was true.
	* LICENSE: Created LICENSE file (using content straight out of the
	  man page).

Tue Feb  7 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Made new release.
	* cpuid.c: Correctly distinguish Egypt/Italy processors.
	* cpuid.c: Fixed minor problems in error checking in open_file().
	* cpuid.spec: Fixed bad Packager field.
	* cpuid.spec: Include ChangeLog.
	* cpuid.man: Added -r/--raw description.
	* cpuid.man: Clarified info used for (synth) field.
	* cpuid.man: Fixed version number & date.
	* Makefile: Reworked to make it easy for people other than me to build
	  and install.
	* cpuid.spec: Used new Makefile organization
	* Makefile: Fixed production of spec file so that it's possible to
	  rebuild with the srpm without having to specify %version and
	  %release.

Mon Feb  6 2006 Todd Allen <todd.allen@etallen.com>
	* Initial public release.
